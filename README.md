===============

Patches for upcoming sound installation in Riverside Park viaduct tunnel.

## viaduct1

Simple dry/wet mixer for an accumulator patch from Luke, used with people sounds and water sounds.

#### Ideas

- Use an amplitude threshold for incoming train sounds or the live feed that will activate wet in an interesting way
- Highlight specific frequency ranges

#### If you have ideas for other patches post them here. Push more little patches that we can integrate!
